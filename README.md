# 🌸 Hello there! 
I'm Carson Frankovich, a highschool student that attends Cypress Bay HS! When I'm not doing school work or playing games, I develop websites and learn as much as I can. I do have a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIbFDtzksXJhI8EJomoaqBg) channel but I rarely post on it. 

# 🌸 My Website 
On [my website](https://carsonf.tech) you will find lots more information about me! The site is still a work in progress since I have so many ideas and side projects!!!

# 🌸 Current Project 
I am currently working on a project called [Teams-Themes](https://github.com/cfrankovich/TeamsThemes) which is a solution to the limited number of themes that Microsoft Teams has.
