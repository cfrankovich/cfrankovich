Hello there! I'm Carson Frankovich, a highschool student that attends Cypress Bay HS! When I'm not doing school work or playing games, I develop websites and learn as much as I can. I do have a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIbFDtzksXJhI8EJomoaqBg) channel but I rarely post oin it. 

I am currently working on a project called [Calendr](https://www.github.com/cfrankovich/Calendr) which is an open-source time management website for highschool stuents like me.
